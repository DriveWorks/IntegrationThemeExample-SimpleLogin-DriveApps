### This example:
- Shows a login screen - credentials attached to a config file.
- Connects to the DriveWorks API.
- After a successful login, renders a DriveApp with a basic external header.
- Displays DriveApp Alias in tab title.

### To use:
1. Clone this repository, or download as a .zip

2. Enter your Integration Theme details into `config.js`
    * `serverUrl` - The URL that hosts your Integration Theme, including any ports.
    * `groupAlias` - The public alias created for the Group containing the project to render - as configured in DriveWorksConfigUser.xml.
        * This *must* be specified for each Group you wish to use.
        * This allows you to mask the true Group name publicly, if desired.
        * See [Integration Theme Settings](https://docs.driveworkspro.com/Topic/IntegrationThemeSettings) for additional guidance.
    * `driveAppName` - The name of the DriveApp to render.
    * `driveAppPingInterval` - [optional] The interval at which to 'ping' the server automatically.
        * This ensures a session is kept alive during inactivity, if desired.

3. Ensure that the Integration Theme server is running, using any of the available methods (e.g. Personal Web Edition, DriveWorks Live, IIS)
    * For more information, see [Selecting the Integration Theme](https://docs.driveworkspro.com/Topic/IntegrationThemeSelect).

4. Host the example locally or on a remote server.
    * Ensure `<corsOrigins>` in DriveWorksConfigUser.xml permits request from this location.
    See [Integration Theme Settings](https://docs.driveworkspro.com/Topic/IntegrationThemeSettings) for additional guidance.

### Troubleshooting:

If encountering any issues, please check the browser's console for error messages (F12).  

If you are unable to use the dynamic library loading demonstrated in this example:
1. In all .html files, uncomment "Option A" & replace "YOUR-DRIVEWORKS-LIVE-SERVER-URL.COM" with the URL of your own DriveWorks Live server that is serving `DriveWorksLiveIntegrationClient.min.js` - including any ports.
    * This should be the URL that hosts the Integration Theme, and serves it's landing page.
    * To check that this URL is correct, attempt to load DriveWorksLiveIntegrationClient.min.js in a browser. It should return a minified code library.
2. Remove the "Option B" `<script>` tag.


### Potential Issues:

* When serving this example for a domain different to your DriveWorks Live server, e.g. api.my-site.com from www.company.com, 'SameSite' cookie warnings may be thrown when the Client SDK attempts to store the current session id in a cookie.
    * This appears as "Error: 401 Unauthorized" in the browser console, even with the correct configuration set.
    * To resolve:
        * Ensure you are running DriveWorks 18.2 or above
        * Ensure HTTPS is enabled in DriveWorks Live's settings
        * Ensure a valid SSL certificate has been configured via DriveWorksConfigUser.xml.
        * Ensure if using an incognito/private window, third-party cookies are not blocked (see browser settings).
        * See [Integration Theme Settings](https://docs.driveworkspro.com/Topic/IntegrationThemeSettings) for additional guidance.
